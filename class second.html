    <h1> poem 1</h1>
    <p>One day came a long, serene rain, Saplings, plants, farmers, reservoirs smiled again. Others gave a frown of pain, Due to foresight, there was no stink or overflowing drains. Then arose the shining sun, It was curtains up for a boon. I looked up with elegant smile, Sweet rainbow appeared within a mile. I met the rainbow at the horizon, It was a joyful, lovely reunion</p>
    <h2>poem 2</h2>
    <p>You get dignity, When you stop thinking wrong When you do what you learn right You can live dignified, When you live a lifestyle that, matches your vision. You can get dignity when you renounce the “ego of individuality”. and rejoice ups and downs of life. There is dignity, when you have good thoughts, in your heart and mind.</p>
