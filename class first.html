    <h1>The Golden Egg</h1>
    <pre>
       
        Once upon a time, there lived a cloth merchant in a village with his wife and two children. 
        They were indeed quite well-off. They had a beautiful hen which laid an egg every day. 
        It was not an ordinary egg, rather, a golden egg. But the man was not satisfied with what he used to get daily. 
        He was a get rich-trice kind of a person.

        The man wanted to get all the golden eggs from his hen at one single go.
         So, one day he thought hard and at last clicked upon a plan. He decided to kill the hen and get all the eggs together.
        
        So, the next day when the hen laid a golden egg, the man caught hold of it, took a sharp knife, chopped off its neck and cut its body open. 
         There was nothing but blood all around & no trace of any egg at all. 
         He was highly grieved because now he would not get even one single egg.
        
        His life was going on smoothly with one egg a day but now, he himself made his life miserable.
         The outcome of his greed was that he started becoming poorer & poorer day by day and ultimately became a pauper. 
         How jinxed and how much foolish he was.

         <strong>morel:</strong> One who desires more, loses all. One should remain satisfied with what one gets.
